This is the first blog post created using the CMS tool. I am very pleased with how easy it was to integrate this with my gatsby app. It will make for the perfect tool to use for my personal blog on my portfolio site. WooooHooooo!

```
const Stoke = styled.div<StokeProps>` color: #334dc5f; padding: 20px 10px; display: ${p => p.netlifyEnabled} ? 'block' : 'none';`const TrevIsStoked: React.FC = () => {return (      <Stoke level={100%} gatsby={100} netlifyEnabled={true} />   ) }
```
